I‚Äôve been building a virtual homelab using Kali Linux and VirtualBox to explore ethical hacking and security concepts. My GitHub repository features scripts, configurations, and documentation that highlight my journey into cybersecurity and cloud security.

Here‚Äôs what you can find on my GitHub:

Security scripts for penetration testing and system hardening.
Configurations for my Kali Linux environment.
Ongoing projects exploring network scanning, vulnerability assessments, and digital forensics.
This repository is a reflection of my passion for learning, experimenting, and sharing knowledge in the field of cybersecurity. Feel free to explore, collaborate, or provide feedback!

Let‚Äôs work together to build secure and resilient systems. üåê
