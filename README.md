# SIEM Virtual Machine Deployment on Azure

## Project Overview
This project involves deploying and configuring a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system on Microsoft Azure. The setup simulates a real-world cybersecurity monitoring environment for threat detection and incident response.

## Objectives
- Deploy a SIEM virtual machine on Azure.
- Configure log sources and analyze security event data.
- Explore Azure services such as virtual networking and role-based access control (RBAC).

## Steps
1. Set up an Azure free trial account.
2. Deployed a virtual machine and installed the SIEM software.
3. Configured log collection from various sources (e.g., Windows Event Logs).
4. Analyzed and visualized event data for threat detection.

## Technologies Used
- **Cloud Platform**: Microsoft Azure
- **SIEM Tool**: AMA Machine, Sentinel, Log Analytics Machine, VM
- **Networking**: Virtual Network, Security Groups
- **Programming**: Structured Query Language (SQL)

## Key Learnings
- Hands-on experience with SIEM tools and Azure portal management.
- Understanding of log analysis and incident response workflows.
- Improved knowledge of virtual networking and access control.
